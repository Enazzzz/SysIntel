# SysIntel - Real-Time System Monitor for Windows



**SysIntel** is a modern, extensible system monitor for Windows built with Python. Inspired by Windows Task Manager, it provides real-time graphs, hardware stats, and efficient loggingâ€”all within a clean, dark-themed GUI. Perfect for system enthusiasts, developers, or anyone who wants deeper control and insight into their PC.

## ðŸ§  AI + Logs

- Logs are written in `sysintel_log.csv` using compact columns:
  - `ts` (timestamp, base36)
  - `cpu`, `mem`, `gpu`, `ct`, `gt`, `fan`
- Ready for trend detection, anomaly alerts, or assistant-style optimization.

---

## ðŸ”® Roadmap Ideas

- AI Assistant (analyze logs, recommend cleanups)
- Graph export / snapshot saving
- Web or mobile dashboards
- Remote monitoring support
- Plugin system for more sensor support
